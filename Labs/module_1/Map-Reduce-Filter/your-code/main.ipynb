Nay, not without wound in thespirit shall I leave this city.  days of pain I have spentwithin its walls, long were thenights of aloneness; who can departfrom his pain his aloneness withoutregret?\\n\\nToo many fragments of spirit have Iscattered in these streets, too manyare children of my longing that walknaked among these hills, I cannotwithdraw from them without burden andan ache.\\nIt is not garment I cast off thisday, but skin that I tear with my ownhands.\\n\\nNor is it thought I leave behind me,but heart made sweet with hunger andwith thirst.\\n*****\\n\\nYet I cannot tarry longer.\\nThe sea that calls all things unto hercalls me, I must embark.\\nFor to stay, though hours burn inthe night, is to freeze crystallizeand be bound in mould.\\nFain would I take with me all that ishere. But how shall I?\\nA voice cannot carry tongue lips that gave it wings. Alonemust it seek ether.\\nAnd alone without his nest shall theeagle fly across sun.\\n*****\\n\\nNow when he reached foot of thehill, he turned again towards sea,and he saw his ship approaching theharbour, upon her prow mariners,the men of his own land.\\nAnd his soul cried out to them, hesaid:\\n\\nSons of my ancient mother, you riders ofthe tides,\\nHow often have you sailed in my dreams.And now you come in my awakening, whichis my deeper dream.\\nReady am I to go, my eagerness withsails full set awaits wind.\\nOnly another breath will I breathe inthis still air, only another loving lookcast backward,\\nAnd then I shall stand among you, aseafarer among seafarers.  you,vast sea, sleepless mother,\\nWho alone are peace freedom to theriver stream,\\nOnly another winding will this streammake, only another murmur in this glade,\\nAnd then shall I come to you, aboundless drop to boundless ocean.\\n*****\\n\\nAnd as he walked he saw from afar menand women leaving their fields theirvineyards hastening towards citygates.\\n\\nAnd he heard their voices calling hisname, shouting from field to fieldtelling one another of coming of hisship.\\n\\nAnd he said to himself:\\nShall day of parting be day ofgathering?\\n\\nAnd shall it be said that my eve was intruth my dawn?\\nAnd what shall I give unto him who hasleft his plough in midfurrow, or tohim who has stopped wheel of hiswinepress?  my heart become atree heavy-laden with fruit that I maygather give unto them?\\nAnd shall my desires flow like afountain that I may fill their cups?\\nAm I harp that hand of mightymay touch me, or flute that his breathmay pass through me?\\nA seeker of silences am I, whattreasure have I found in silences that Imay dispense with confidence?\\nIf this is my day of harvest, in whatfields have I sowed seed, inwhat unremembered seasons?\\nIf this indeed be hour in which Ilift up my lantern, it is not my flamethat shall burn therein.\\nEmpty dark shall I raise my lantern,\\nAnd guardian of night shall fillit with oil he shall light it also.\\n*****\\n\\nThese things he said in words. But muchin his heart remained unsaid. For  could not speak his deepersecret.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n[Illustration: 0020]\\nAnd when he entered into city allthe people came to meet him, theywere crying out to him as with onevoice.\\n\\nAnd elders of city stood forthand said:\\nGo not yet away from us.\\nA noontide have you been in ourtwilight, your youth has given usdreams to dream.\\nNo stranger are you among us, nora guest, but our son our dearlybeloved.\\n\\nSuffer not yet our eyes to hunger foryour face.\\n*****\\n\\nAnd priests priestesses saidunto him:\\nLet not waves of sea separate usnow, years you have spent in ourmidst become memory.\\nYou have walked among us spirit, your shadow has been lightupon our faces.\\nMuch have we loved you. But speechlesswas our love, with veils has it beenveiled.\\n\\nYet now it cries aloud unto you, andwould stand revealed before you.\\nAnd ever has it been that love knowsnot its own depth until hour ofseparation.\\n\\n*****\\n\\nAnd others came also entreated him.But he answered them not. He only benthis head; those who stood near sawhis tears falling upon his breast.\\nAnd he people proceeded towardsthe great square before temple.\\nAnd there came out of sanctuary awoman whose name was Almitra. And shewas seeress.\\nAnd he looked upon her with exceedingtenderness, for it was she who had firstsought believed in him when he hadbeen but day in their city.  hailed him, saying:\\nProphet of God, in quest of theuttermost, long have you searched thedistances for your ship.\\nAnd now your ship has come, you mustneeds go.\\nDeep is your longing for land ofyour memories dwelling placeof your greater desires; our lovewould not bind you nor our needs holdyou.\\n\\nYet this we ask ere you leave us, thatyou speak to us give us of yourtruth.\\n\\nAnd we will give it unto our children,and they unto their children, itshall not perish.\\nIn your aloneness you have watched withour days, in your wakefulness youhave listened to weeping thelaughter of our sleep.\\nNow therefore disclose us to ourselves,and tell us all that has been shownyou of that which is between birth anddeath.\\n\\n*****\\n\\nAnd he answered,\\nPeople of Orphalese, of what can I save of that which is even nowmoving within your souls?\\n***** *****\\nThen said Almitra, Speak to us of_Love_.\\n\\nAnd he raised his head looked uponthe people, there fell stillnessupon them. And with great voice hesaid:\\n\\nWhen love beckons to you, follow him,\\nThough his ways are hard steep.\\nAnd when his wings enfold you yield tohim,\\n\\nThough sword hidden among hispinions may wound you.\\nAnd when he speaks to you believe inhim,\\n\\nThough his voice may shatter your dreamsas north wind lays waste garden.\\nFor even as love crowns you so shallhe crucify you. Even as he is for yourgrowth so is he for your pruning.\\nEven as he ascends to your height your tenderest branchesthat quiver in sun,\\nSo shall he descend to your roots andshake them in their clinging to theearth.\\n\\n*****\\n\\nLike sheaves of corn he gathers you untohimself.\\n\\nHe threshes you to make you naked.\\nHe sifts you to free you from yourhusks.\\n\\nHe grinds you to whiteness.\\nHe kneads you until you are pliant;\\nAnd then he assigns you to his sacredfire, that you may become sacred breadfor God’s sacred feast.\\n*****\\n\\nAll these things shall love do unto youthat you may know secrets of yourheart, in that knowledge become afragment of Life’s heart.\\nBut if in your fear you would seek onlylove’s peace love’s pleasure,\\nThen it is better for you that youcover  nakedness pass out oflove’s threshing-floor,\\nInto seasonless world where youshall laugh, but not all of yourlaughter, weep, but not all of yourtears.\\n\\n*****\\n\\nLove gives naught but itself takesnaught but from itself.\\nLove possesses not nor would it bepossessed;\\n\\nFor love is sufficient unto love.\\nWhen you love you should not say, “Godis in my heart,” but rather, “I am inthe heart of God.”\\nAnd think not you can direct courseof love, for love, if it finds youworthy, directs your course.\\nLove has no other desire but to fulfilitself.\\n\\nBut if you love must needs havedesires, let these be your desires:\\nTo melt be like running brook thatsings its melody to night.  pain of too much tenderness.\\nTo be wounded by your own understandingof love;\\nAnd to bleed willingly joyfully.\\nTo wake at dawn with winged heart andgive thanks for another day of loving;\\nTo rest at noon hour meditatelove’s ecstacy;\\nTo return home at eventide withgratitude;\\n\\nAnd then to sleep with prayer forthe beloved in your heart song ofpraise upon your lips.\\n[Illustration: 0029]\\n***** *****\\n Almitra spoke again said,And what of _Marriage_ master?\\nAnd he answered saying:\\nYou were born together, together youshall be forevermore.\\nYou shall be together when whitewings of death scatter your days.\\nAye, you shall be together even in thesilent memory of God.\\nBut let there be spaces in yourtogetherness,\\n\\nAnd let winds of heavens dancebetween you.\\n*****\\n\\nLove one another, but make not bond oflove:\\n\\nLet it rather be moving sea betweenthe shores of your souls.\\nFill each other’s cup but drink not fromone cup.\\nGive one another of your bread but eatnot from same loaf.  anddance together be joyous, but leteach one of you be alone,\\nEven as strings of lute are alonethough they quiver with same music.\\n*****\\n\\nGive your hearts, but not into eachother’s keeping.\\nFor only hand of Life can containyour hearts.\\nAnd stand together yet not too neartogether:\\n\\nFor pillars of temple standapart,\\n\\nAnd oak tree cypress grownot in each other’s shadow.\\n[Illustration: 0032]\\n***** *****\\n woman who held babeagainst her bosom said, Speak to us of_Children_.\\n\\nAnd he said:\\nYour children are not your children.\\nThey are sons daughters ofLife’s longing for itself.\\nThey come through you but not from you,\\nAnd though they are with you yet theybelong not to you.\\n*****\\n\\nYou may give them your love but not yourthoughts,\\n\\nFor they have their own thoughts.\\nYou may house their bodies but not theirsouls,\\n\\nFor their souls dwell in house oftomorrow, which you cannot visit, noteven in your dreams.\\nYou may strive to be like them, but seeknot to make them like you.  goes not backward nor tarries withyesterday.\\n\\nYou are bows from which yourchildren as living arrows are sentforth.\\n\\nThe archer sees mark upon pathof infinite, He bends you withHis might that His arrows may go swiftand far.\\nLet your bending in Archer’s hand befor gladness;\\nFor even as he loves arrow thatflies, so He loves also bow that isstable.\\n\\n***** *****\\n said rich man, Speak to us of_Giving_.\\n\\nAnd he answered:\\nYou give but little when you give ofyour possessions.\\nIt is when you give of yourself that youtruly give.\\nFor what are your possessions but thingsyou keep guard for fear you may needthem tomorrow?\\nAnd tomorrow, what shall tomorrow bringto overprudent dog burying bonesin trackless sand as he follows thepilgrims to holy city?\\nAnd what is fear of need but needitself?\\n\\nIs not dread of thirst when your well isfull, thirst that is unquenchable?\\nThere are those who give little of which they have--and they giveit for recognition their hiddendesire makes their gifts unwholesome.\\nAnd there are those who have little andgive it all.\\nThese are believers in life andthe bounty of life, their coffer isnever empty.\\nThere are those who give with joy, andthat joy is their reward.\\nAnd there are those who give with pain,and that pain is their baptism.\\nAnd there are those who give knownot pain in giving, nor do they seekjoy, nor give with mindfulness ofvirtue;\\n\\nThey give as in yonder valley myrtlebreathes its fragrance into space.\\nThrough hands of such as these Godspeaks, from behind their eyes Hesmiles upon earth.\\n[Illustration: 0039]\\nIt is well to give when asked, but itis better to give unasked, throughunderstanding;\\n\\nAnd to open-handed search for who shall receive is joy greaterthan giving.\\nAnd is there aught you would withhold?\\nAll you have shall some day be given;\\nTherefore give now, that seasonof giving may be yours not yourinheritors’.\\n\\nYou often say, “I would give, but onlyto deserving.”\\nThe trees in your orchard say not so,nor flocks in your pasture.\\nThey give that they may live, for towithhold is to perish.\\nSurely he who is worthy to receive hisdays his nights, is worthy of allelse from you.\\nAnd he who has deserved to drink fromthe ocean of life deserves to fill hiscup from your little stream.\\nAnd what desert greater shall there be,than that which lies in courageand confidence, nay charity, ofreceiving?\\n\\nAnd who are you that men should rend bosom unveil their pride,that you may see their worth naked andtheir pride unabashed?\\nSee first that you yourself deserve tobe giver, instrument of giving.\\nFor in truth it is life that gives untolife--while you, who deem yourself agiver, are but witness.\\nAnd you receivers--and you areall receivers--assume no weight ofgratitude, lest you lay yoke uponyourself upon him who gives.\\nRather rise together with giver onhis gifts as on wings;\\nFor to be overmindful of your debt, isito doubt his generosity who has thefreehearted earth for mother, Godfor father.\\n[Illustration: 0042]\\n***** *****\\n old man, keeper of aninn, said, Speak to us of _Eating andDrinking_.\\n\\nAnd he said:\\nWould that you could live on thefragrance of earth, like airplant be sustained by light.\\nBut since you must kill to eat, robthe newly born of its mother’s milk toquench your thirst, let it then be anact of worship,\\nAnd let your board stand altar onwhich pure innocent offorest plain are sacrificed for thatwhich is purer still more innocentin man.\\n*****\\n\\nWhen you kill beast say to him in yourheart,\\n\\n“By same power that slays you, I tooam slain; I too shall be consumed. law that delivered you intomy hand shall deliver me into mightierhand.\\n\\nYour blood my blood is naught butthe sap that feeds tree of heaven.”\\n*****\\n\\nAnd when you crush apple with yourteeth, say to it in your heart,\\n“Your seeds shall live in my body,\\nAnd buds of your tomorrow shallblossom in my heart,\\nAnd your fragrance shall be my breath,And together we shall rejoice throughall seasons.”\\n*****\\n\\nAnd in autumn, when you gatherthe grapes of your vineyards for thewinepress, say in your heart,\\n“I too am vineyard, my fruit shallbe gathered for winepress,\\nAnd like new wine I shall be kept ineternal vessels.”\\nAnd in winter, when you draw wine, there be in your heart songfor each cup;\\nAnd let there be in song aremembrance for autumn days, forthe vineyard, for winepress.\\n*****\\n*****\\n\\n Then ploughman said, Speakto us of _Work_.\\nAnd he answered, saying:\\nYou work that you may keep pace with theearth soul of earth.\\nFor to be idle is to become strangerunto seasons, to step out oflife’s procession, that marches inmajesty proud submission towards theinfinite.\\n\\nWhen you work you are flute throughwhose heart whispering of hoursturns to music.\\nWhich of you would be reed, dumb andsilent, when all else sings together

sow seeds with tenderness andreap harvest with joy, even as ifyour beloved were to eat fruit.\\nIt is to charge all things you fashionwith breath of your own spirit,\\nAnd to know that all blessed

seizesthe rainbow to lay it on cloth in thelikeness of man, is more than he whomakes sandals for our feet.”\\nBut I say, not in sleep but in theoverwakefulness of noontide, that thewind speaks not more sweetly to thegiant oaks than to least of all theblades of grass;\\nAnd he alone is great who turns thevoice of wind into song madesweeter by his own loving.\\n*****\\n\\nWork is love made visible.\\nAnd if you cannot work with love butonly with distaste, it is better thatyou should leave your work sit atthe gate of temple take alms ofthose who work with joy.\\nFor if you bake bread with indifference,you bake bitter bread that feeds buthalf man’s hunger.\\nAnd if you grudge crushing of thegrapes, your grudge distils poison inthe wine.  if you sing though asangels, love not

wine thevery cup that was burned in potter’soven?\\n\\nAnd is not lute that soothes yourspirit, very wood that was hollowedwith knives?\\nWhen you are joyous, look deep into yourheart you shall find it is onlythat which has given you sorrow that isgiving you joy.\\nWhen you are sorrowful look again in heart, you shall see thatin truth you are weeping for that whichhas been your delight.\\n*****\\n\\nSome of you say, “Joy is greater thansorrow,” others say, “Nay, sorrow isthe greater.”\\nBut I say unto you, they areinseparable.\\n\\nTogether they come, when one sitsalone with you at your board, rememberthat other is asleep upon your bed.\\nVerily you are suspended like scalesbetween your sorrow your joy.\\nOnly when you are empty are you atstandstill balanced.\\nWhen

For forty years, he produced anddistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only loose network ofvolunteer support.\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printededitions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright inthe U.S. unless copyright notice is included. Thus, we do notnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paperedition.\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has main PG searchfacility: www.gutenberg.org\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,including how to make donations to Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, how tosubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n'"
